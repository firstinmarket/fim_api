    <h1>Privacy Policy for FIM News App</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 5, 2025</p>

```
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>FIM Tech (“we”, “our”, or “us”) operates the FIM News App (the “App”), which aggregates news and provides article summaries. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights. By using the App you agree to this policy.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect information necessary to operate and improve the App:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Device &amp; Usage Data:</strong> device model, OS version, app version, anonymized device identifiers, crash logs, performance metrics, and usage analytics.</li>
  <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> email address or contact details when voluntarily provided (feedback, subscriptions).</li>
  <li><strong>Content Source Data:</strong> when fetching third-party RSS feeds or APIs, those sources may collect data according to their policies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
<p>Uses include: providing and maintaining the App, diagnosing issues, improving user experience, and sending optional transactional messages or newsletters (with consent). We do not sell personal data.</p>

<h2>4. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
<p>If analytics or ad SDKs are used, those third parties may independently collect device and usage information. We will disclose such integrations in the App and provide opt-out choices where possible.</p>

<h2>5. Push Notifications</h2>
<p>We may send push notifications for news and updates with your permission. You can disable them in device settings.</p>

<h2>6. Permissions</h2>
<p>The App requests only permissions necessary for core functionality (network access, local storage for caching). Each permission is explained at runtime.</p>

<h2>7. Data Sharing &amp; Third Parties</h2>
<p>We may share data with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Service providers processing data on our behalf (hosting, analytics, email)</li>
  <li>Legal authorities where required by law</li>
  <li>Buyers or partners in the event of a business transfer</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not share personal data for third-party marketing without explicit consent.</p>

<h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain usage and device logs as necessary to operate the App and meet legal obligations. Personal data provided for support or subscriptions will be retained only as needed.</p>

<h2>9. Security</h2>
<p>We use reasonable measures to protect data, but no service is fully secure. If a breach occurs, we will follow applicable notification laws.</p>

<h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The App is not intended for children under 13 (or under 16 where GDPR requires higher age). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have collected child data, contact us and we will delete it promptly.</p>

<h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Depending on local law, you may request access, correction, deletion, or portability of your personal data. Contact us to exercise those rights.</p>

<h2>12. International Transfers</h2>
<p>Data may be processed or stored outside your country. We put protections in place when international transfers occur.</p>

<h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy. Material changes will be posted with a new date and, when appropriate, notified to users.</p>

<h2>14. Contact Us</h2>
<p>For questions, requests, or privacy concerns contact: <strong>support@fimtech.example</strong> (replace with your official support email).</p>
